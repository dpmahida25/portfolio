        <p>The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simplicity . Often, simple things are clear if the message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data. </p>

        <p class="alert">This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of data, as simplification usually does. </p>

        <p>Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing” of information rather than the illumination of it.</p>

        <h3>Questions</h3>

        <p>Please answeer the following questions below. Remember to markup the information properly using HTML</p>

        <h4>Explain the difference between the "alt” attribute and the "title” attribute.</h4>  
        <p>The alt text specifies what text will be displayed on the site in case the image is not loaded due to poor network or if the image is not found while the title is one of the ways in HTML to identify an website element.</p>
        <h4>Please provide an example of how to mark up a definition from the dictionary below </h4>
        <p> dic·​tio·​nary | \ ˈdik-shə-ˌner-ē\
            A reference source in print or electronic form containing words usually alphabetically arranged along with information about their forms, pronunciations, functions, etymologies, meanings, and syntactic and idiomatic uses </p>
      <p>" I still read relatively slowly in Yiddish, with frequent recourse to a dictionary, and my first year of graduate school found me at my desk till two or three in the morning every night "</p>
